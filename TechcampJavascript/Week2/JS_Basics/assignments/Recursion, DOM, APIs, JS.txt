Meaning of recursion? and where it can be applied
- Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself to solve a problem. Each recursive call works on a smaller piece of the problem, and the function continues to call itself until it reaches a base caseâ€”a condition that stops the recursion.
- It can be applied in Math Computations, Data Structures, OS functions, Game Theory, etc.
